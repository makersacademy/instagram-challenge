Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need users who can post pictures, write comments on pictures and like a picture. It will need to look like the instagrams website or better.

Rails site.

Users:
  - Can post pictures
  - Can comment on pictures (many times per picture)
  - Can like a picture (once per picture)

Posts/pictures:
  - Posted by a user.
  - Can have comments, description (and image!)
  - Can have likes
  - Shoudl display comments, total number of likes etc.

Comments/description:
  - Posted by a user, on a post/picture
  - Can have likes? (OPTIONAL)

Likes:
  - Posted by a user, on a post/picture/[optionally on comments]
  - Only one per user per post, unlimited total though.

Nice to have:
  - CSS/Design quite important, probably use jquery etc. To make look like instagram.
  - Can tag other users in comments.
