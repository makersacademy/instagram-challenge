I want the ability to login to Instagram
so that I can have post associated to me

so that people don't post as me

so that I can post about my life

As a user
I want the ability to click a specific post
so that I can review a post in more detail

As the owner of a post
I want the ability to edit my posts
so that I can make changes

As the owner of a post
I want the ability to delete my posts
so that I can remove pictures I no longer want to display
