### User Stories
```
As a user,
so that I can share my photographs with the strangers of the internet,
I would like to be able to upload and display a photograph.
```

```
As a user,
so that I can look at other users' photos,
I would like to be able to see a feed of uploaded images.
```

```
As a user,
So that I can post photos and comments as me,
I would like to be able to sign up for an account.
```

```
As a user,
So that I can impose my opinions on a wide audience,
I would like to be able to comment on photos.
```

```
As a user,
So that I do not have to actually type to signal my approval,
I would like to be able to 'like' a photo.
```
