Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Bonus if you can write your own set of sensible user stories!

As usual please start by forking this repo. After cloning your fork and cd'ing into it, you'll need to [initialize a Rails app in the current directory](http://blog.jasonmeridth.com/posts/create-rails-application-in-current-directory/).

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

# Instagram Clone

I have created an Instagram Clone, which is a popular web application that allows users to create, comment on and like photos. This clone was built using the Ruby on Rails framework.


## How to Use the App

- In the terminal, ```git clone https://github.com/DarkChocLatte/instagram-challenge```.

- In the terminal, cd into ```instagram_clone```.

- In the terminal, create your databases by running the ```bin/rake db:create``` command.

- In the terminal, migrate your databases by running the ```bin/rake db:migrate``` command.

- In the terminal, run the rails server by running the ```bin/rails s``` command.

- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in the browser
