As a user, 
So that I can control my usage to addictive social media

As a user, 
So I can show people what I'm up to,

Notes and reflections: 

Theres a lot which isn't working here! 
First off my rpsec isn't working and I can't work out why. Each time I ran a test it would throw an error which I didn't understand I spent a lot time triyng to work it out and eventually gave up. 
I also was trying to get ActiveStorage to work and struggled with that 
Andddd the log in and log out and sessions is only half implemented.
