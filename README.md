#Instagram Challenge#

Makers Academy Wk8 Challenge to build an instagram clone using rails. To add some personal interest to this I have added a particular theme to provide a service to allow site engineers to post photos of their work and allow colleagues to comment/like on this work as a peer review stratergy and communication system between site and office engineers. Introducing Engigram!
