Instagram Challenge
===================

## Task

Build Instagram

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

### User stories

So that other people can see what I am doing

So that people know what is the context of the picture
I want to be able to add a caption and location

So that I can see what other people are doing
I want to see all pictures in reverse chronological order

As a user
So that I can see where the pictures were taken

I want to sign up with email and password

As a user
So that I will be able to come back without signing up again
I want to be able to log in and log out

As a user
