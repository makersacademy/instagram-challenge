As a visitor,
So I can see what Instagram has to offer,

As a user,
So that I can start sharing pictures,
I would like to sign up with my email, user handle, and password.
```

As a user,
So I can share a picture with the world,
I would like to be able to upload images to Instagram.

As a user,
So I can provide context to my posts,
I would like to add descriptions to images when posting.
```
```
As a user,
So I can show my reaction to Instagram images,

As a user,
So I can show my appreciation for good posts,
I would like to be able to 'like' images.
