Instagram Challenge
===================

This is my response to the Makers Instagram Challenge, which I wrote in Javascript. I completed a styled homepage which shows uploaded photos including name and description.
There is a separate page to upload photos.

It uses:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web framework for Node.js.
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to reload the server automatically.
- [Jade](https://https://jade-lang.com/) to render view templates.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) to model objects in MongoDB.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing.
- [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer/) for file storage.

## Examples of Use

## Task I followed

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!
