Instagram Challenge
===================

NB: This is not actually Instagram Challenge! I've attempted to build of my own
project which has very similar requirements to Instagram (but would be immediately
useful in my local community right now if it was an actual website!)

The aim is to produce a database version of local baby activity listings websites
such as these:

User Stories (v1)

       Suitable for:  Babies
       Venue:         St Hilda's Church

Task
-----

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Bonus if you can write your own set of sensible user stories!

As usual please start by

* Filling out your learning plan self review for the week: https://github.com/makersacademy/learning_plan_october2015 (if you haven't already)
* Forking this repo. After cloning your fork and cd'ing into it, you'll need to [initialize a Rails app in the current directory](http://blog.jasonmeridth.com/posts/create-rails-application-in-current-directory/).

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!
