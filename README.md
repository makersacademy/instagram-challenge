Instagram Challenge üì∏üôÜüèª
===================

This weekend's challenge was to recreate Instagram using Ruby on Rails.

## Approach

Before anything, I had divided the functionalities into user stories. This allowed me to
understand what my 'Instagram program' needed to do. From there, I ordered the user stories
one by one, starting from an MVP and expanding outwards to accomplish the rest of the user
stories. This was a method for deciding my strategy on how I go about making the program.
Then, I listed what was required to accomplish each User story.

I managed to get halfway through by setting up my two top MVPS. I did not have time
to do the API creation to do the user sign in, login and logout unfortunately. 

## User Stories MVP (Accomplished)

## Other User stories (That I would like to acheived) 

```

```

```
As an Instagram User,

I would like to be able to sign up.
```
```
As an Instagram User,
so that I can use Instagram under my account,
I would like to be able to login.
```

```
As an Instagram User,
so that I am the only one who can see my Instagram,
I would like to be able to logout.
```

```
As an Instagram User,
so that I can use Instagram easily,
I would like to be able to have a sexy interface
```

```

```

## How to use:

1. Clone the repo on the laptop. 
```
git clone https://github.com/thatdania/instagram-challenge.git
```

2. Go into the project folder
```
cd/instagram-challenge
```

3. get all the gems and dependencies 
```
bundle install 
```

4. run the following command to get the possible routes  
```
bin/rails routes 
```

5. run the server and check the Work in Progress so far!
```
bin/rails s
```


## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.48.1"
gem "rubocop-rails"
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB ‚Äî feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code ‚Äî and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
