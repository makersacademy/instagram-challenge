This is my attempt at the Makers Academy Instagram challenge.

Here is what I managed to implement:

- Users can sign up
- Users can log in and out
- Users can post pictures
- Users can edit their profile page and upload an avatar
- Users can delete their posts

I didn't yet implement:

- Comments on posts
- Likes on posts
