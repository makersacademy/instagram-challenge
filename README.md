What I learnt From The Project.
</h4>

- I gained a strong understanding of rails MVC.
- I learnt how to create a ``secure`` ``login`` and ``logout`` system without using a third party gem like ``devise``.
- I leant how to use ``rails`` ``before actions `` and ``helper modules``.
- I learnt how to use ``sqlite with rails``.
- I learnt how to use rails ``url_for``.
- I leant how to test-drive rails application ``still have a long way to go thogh``.

- I leant a lot about ``active record association ``.


<h4 align="center">
Struggles
</h4>

> The struggle was real.

- I initially struggled to with association and linking models together.
- I am still not ``100%`` unblocked but it is better today than is was yesterday.
- Structuring the application.
- Testing some part of the code base was a myth. `` I had to spike``.

> Now that I have a clear understanding of rails, I will delete the application and do it again the makers way. 100% TDD.

<h4 align="center">
Bugs
</h4>

> There are few bugs currently in the application that needs fixing.
- I need to fixed errors generated as a resort of ``current user`` method.
- I need to create a 404 route, so that setting ``endpoints`` when manually navigated to will raise a ``404 error``.
- I need to improve the code base.
- Application has ``two`` failing test.
