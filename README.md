## Moments User Stories

```
As a new user,
so I can use the Moments web application,
I want to sign up and login to Moments.

As a user,
so I can share my pictures with the world,
I want to post an image with a caption that is visible in a post feed.

As a user,
so I know that a post is my own post,
I want to see my username visible with the post in the post feed.

As a user,
so I can have more fun on the application
and share with my friends that are not members,
I want to be able to see all posts by all users (even when not logged in) int he post feed.

As a user,
so I can let people know that I like their post,
I want to be able to submit a like vote
and see the total votes for each post.

As a user,
so I can communicate with other users about their posts,
I want to be able to write comments about posts
as well as see all comments for each post.

As a user,
so I know when users have made posts,
I want to see the relative time when each post was posted.

```
