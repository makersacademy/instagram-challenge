This project is our 8th weekend challenge and our first week of Rails framework. Completed solo on 8th-9th July 2018. We were tasked with creating a clone of instagram!

## Instructions:  
```
Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).
```

## MVP:

I came up with the following user stories and mock up for my MVP:

<img src="./mvp_user_flow_screenshot.40.30.png" />

```
As a user,
So that I can see what people are up to,
I can see peoples most recent posts
```
```
As a user,
So that I can use instagram,
I can sign up
```
```
As a user,
So that I can access my account,
I can log in
```
```
As a user,
So that I can share what's going on in my life,
I can make a post
```

Resources Used:

For using Devise gem for login & authentication
1. Documentation for devise: https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#strong-parameters
2. Adding custom fields to devise registration: http://www.peoplecancode.com/tutorials/adding-custom-fields-to-devise
3. Followed this guide for getting devise up and running: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrC37eeMNIY

For testing
1. To stub authentication in controller spec:
https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Stub-authentication-in-controller-specs

For uploading image:
1. CarrierWave gem: https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave
2. I found this video useful, it does image upload without CarrierWave (to show you what carrierwave
  automates) and then with it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8wF9RrJhrY&t=1171s
3. I found this guide useful: https://www.learnenough.com/course/ruby_on_rails_tutorial_4th_edition/user_microposts/micropost_images/basic_image_upload

Devise could not find the `Warden::Proxy` instance on your request environment error:
