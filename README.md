Instagram Challenge
===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Leigan0/instagram-challenge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Leigan0/instagram-challenge)

This is my first solo app created using the Rails framework, completed over a weekend.

I have attempted to recreate the basic functionality of instagram using a rails framework. I have aimed to complete the challenge following TDD process.

In order to build my understanding of rails I have created this project without using the scaffold command to help my learning of the framework.

I have attempted to write controller and model tests, but given more time I would work on this. I have mainly implemented the app using feature testing.

Given more time I would increase functionality. I would improve my controller and model tests, and gain further insight into these areas. Whilst I have feature tests the testing needs to be improved for greater test coverage of the features of the app. The feature test I have could also be refactored to remove duplication.

I have had a focus on learning rails basics, so I am aware improvements are needed in the convention, and there are areas of the tests and code base which could by improved with helper methods.
