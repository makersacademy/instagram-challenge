Instagram Challenge
==================

Maker's Academy weekend challenge to recreate a popular app that allows a user to post pictures of their brunch.

The app is deployed on heroku at https://powerful-fortress-65722.herokuapp.com/.

Uploaded images are hosted on Amazon S3, since heroku doesn't support permanent storage of files.
