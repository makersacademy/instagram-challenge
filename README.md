Instagram Challenge
===================

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## User stories

**Completed stories:**

```
As a developer
I want a basic rails app up and running
So that I can implement features for users
```

```
As a user
I want to post some text
So that other people can see my post
```

```
As a user
I want to comment on someone else's post
So that I can react to the content of someone else's post
```

```
As a user
I want to add an image to my post
So that other people can see the image
```

**Not started stories:**

```
As a user
I want to like someone else's posts
So that I can react to the content of someone else's post
```

```
As a user
I want to sign up and log in
So that I can create my own posts and react to other people's posts
```
