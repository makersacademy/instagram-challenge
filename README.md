# Impostagram
## Makers Academy Weekend Challenge

### What It Does
Emulates the website for taking photos of unconsumed foods, legs on beaches and
other whimsical things. 

#### How This Will Get Done
Going to try running 
```
bin/rails generate impostagram
```

if that fails, I'm screwed

#### User Stories
```
As a person of some importance
So that I don't get sued
I'd like to keep other from posting stuff as me
```

```
As a whimsical person 
So that I can check out my legs on beaches I've visited
I'd like to stick these photos of legs on the intertubes
```
