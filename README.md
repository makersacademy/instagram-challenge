## Process:
This weekend, I made a point to start early. Unfortunately, I ran into an error with webpack early on and was unable to solve it. I spent hours attempting to debug it, with no avail.

On Sunday, I decided to start fresh. I also used a walkthrough/tutorial as I wanted to focus primarily on learning Rails. The downside to this is that I did not use TDD for this app. Additionally, I wasn't able to implement some of the features in my user stories, as they were out of the scope of the tutorial, and I ran out of time.

Ultimately, I would love to revisit this project and use true TDD â€“ but am extremely happy with what I have learnt from it.
