## Planning

### User Stories

```
As a user,
So I can share my favourite moments,
I'd like to be able to create a post.
```
```
As a user,
So that I can better show off my favourite memories,
I'd like to include images in my posts.
```
```
As a user,
So that I can post as myself,
I'd like to sign-up.
```
```
As a user,
So that no-one else can post as me,
I'd like to log out.
```
```
As a user, 
So that I can interact with other users,
I'd like to be able to 'like' another post.
```
