```

## Technologies used:
Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, RSPEC, Capybara

## Features:
- visitor can add a post
- root page shows all posts with image, description and author

## Features in development:
- user can like posts
- user authentication
- user can add comments to posts

## Reflections:
- lots of time spent on fixing Heroku - creating a Procfile was essential to prevent it from crashing
- similarly with Github actions, creating a Github workflow file was time consuming but made everything smooth - it executes database migrations and installs specific versions on dependencies
- Bootstrap seemed relatively easy to use
