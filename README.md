## Instructions

- If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
- You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## How to start

1. Produce some stories, break them down into tasks, and estimate
2. Fork this repo, clone, etc
3. Initialize a new rails project

Remember to proceed in small steps! Getting confused? Make the steps even smaller.

## User stories

### User story 1

As a user, I want to be able to log in

### User story 2

As a user, I want to post pictures

### User story 3

As a user, I want to be able to comment on the pictures.

### User story 3

As a user, I want to be able to like the pictures.

## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rubocop', '1.20', require: false
  gem 'rubocop-rails'
end
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
