Instagram Challenge
===================

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

STRAIGHT UP

As a User
So that I can show others my pictures 
I want to post a Jam to InstaJam

As a User
So that I can see other's pictures
I want to see all Jams most recent first

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a User
So that I can identify my own pictures
I want to sign up for InstaJam

HARDER

As a User
So that only I can post Jams as me
I want to log in to InstaJam

As a User
So that I can avoid others posting messages on InstaJam
I want to log out of Instajam

ADVANCED

As a Maker
So that people can see a demonstration of my app
I want to host it on Heroku
```
