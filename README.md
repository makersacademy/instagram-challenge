# Instagram
by Paula Muldoon (Makers Academy remote April 2017 cohort)

### About
I spent one weekend creating this clone of Instagram.

---

## Run locally
View the repository [here](https://github.com/pmuldoon86/instagram-challenge) on GitHub

Clone the repo. Then:

```bash
bundle install
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate
```
#### To run the tests
```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

### To view in browser
```bash
bin/rails server
```
Then start the server at localhost:3000

## Processes
* TDD

---
## Technologies used

* [Ruby 2.4.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) as the main back-end language
* [Rails 5.1.1](http://rubyonrails.org/) for the framework
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for handling databases
* Vanilla CSS and Chrome DevTools to inspect the real Instagram's styling
* Git for version managing

## Images
Images currently stored in the repo owing to verification issues with Amazon Web Services and simply not enough time to move them elsewhere.
