# README

For repo https://github.com/james1968/instagram-challenge

Clone or download repo to local directory.

Run bundle install to ensure all gems are up to date.

To run the application run "Rails Server"

And go to localhost:3000/pictures

PLEASE NOTE - this build only covers basic initial functionality to allow a user to upload a picture and add a comment.  There is an additional comments field to allow other users to add comments and also for the pictures and comments to be displayed on a page of their own.

The application is work in progress and I am aware there are many more areas of functionality to be covered.
