## My Approach
This was obviously a huge task so the first thing I did was to break down the requirements into user stories.
The first one being, "as a User so I can show off my photography skills to the world, I want to post a picture and see it displayed"
I then initialized a rails project which gave me easy access to the three tier architecture of a model, view and controller.

I then set up my spec files and created some routes through rails command 'resources'.
Since I had looked at using the devise gem for handling User authentication, I decided instead to change the first user story to implement to "as a user who would like to show off my photography skills to the world, I would like to sign up and see a confirmation displayed"

After covering edge cases I implemented the second user story: as a user keen to show off my photography skills. When I log into the app I want to see an option to add a photo.
