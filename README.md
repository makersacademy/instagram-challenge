Build Instagram: Simple huh!

As usual please start by

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome). 

Bonus if you can add filters! 

Technologies used 
-----

Ruby On Rails (full stack, Web application framework)
Tested using RSpec (provides a behaviour driven development framework for the language, allowing to write application scenarios and test them.)
Shoulda (Ruby gem for testing)
Devise (Ruby gem which handles building a user model, routes for your users controller)
Poltergeist (headless browser for Capybara based on PhantomJS (scripted, headless browser used for automating web page interaction; provides a JavaScript API enabling automated navigation, screenshots, user behavior and assertions making it a common tool used to run browser-based unit tests in a headless system like a continuous integration environment))

To do:
-----

Add in 'Likes' functionality with corresponding tests. Check pluralize method is working (in both localhost and testing environment)

Correct Rspec/Capybara tests to validate image on screen

Attribute users to comments and likes

Add image to photo's profile page

Tests to cover all facets of authentication as per app/controllers/photos_controller.rb and app/controllers/comments_controller.rb
