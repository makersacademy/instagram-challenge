## Self-assessment  

I spent eight hours on this challenge and managed to satisfy all of my learning objectives, although I didn't quite manage to implement all of the user stories I made. My process was by no means perfect; usually, I am fairly fasitidious about test-driving my code, but because of my lack of familiarity with Rails I had to spike quite a few of the features and test retrospectively. This was not ideal. My test-coverage is also not as comprehensive as I would like (I haven't even begun to consider edge cases) and my routing is more RESTless than RESTful. Nevertheless, I have learned a lot about Rails by undertaking this challenge, which was the objective after all. I am confident that I can apply what I have learned to future projects, on which I will be able to take my time and observe best practices.
