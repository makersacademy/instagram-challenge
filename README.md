Instagram Challenge
===================

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## User Stories
```
As a user interested in Instagram  
I would like to sign up to the app  

As user that already has an account  
I would like to sign in to Instagram  

As a developer in charge of Instagram creation  
So as to protect users privacy  
I would like to allow users to only sign in with their account details  

As a user of Instagram  
So I can share my life in pictures  
I would like to be able to post pictures of my cat etc.   

As a user of Instagram  
So others can have a say about my cats  
I would like others commenting on my pictures  

As a user of Instagram  
So others can have a say about my cats  
I would like if others can also like my pictures 
```
