**This is a web application that allows users to post pictures and like/comment on other users' pictures**

Working on my own. I used Rails to develop a copy of the website of Instagram in only 2 days!
I used the following technologies : Ruby, Rails, Jquery, Javascript, PSQL, AWS S3, Rspec, Capybara.
