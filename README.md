Instagram Challenge
===================

This is my Instagram clone in Rails made over the weekend following Week 8 of Makers Acacdemy. I Implemented the user story features: add a photo, see photos and add a caption.

**Test coverage:** SimpleCov. Models: 100%, Controllers: 93%. Load coverage/index.html in a browser for full report.

**Code quality:** RuboCop (not run yet)

## How to explore this project

1. Make a clone of this repo on your local machine using
`git clone https://github.com/katemyoung/instagram-challenge.git`

2. Navigate to the `instagram-challenge` directory
`cd instagram-challenge `

3. Check you have the required ruby, sqlite3, node, yarn and rails versiovs installed. (Link to getting started)

3. Use Bundler to install the dependencies from the Gemfile
`bundle install`

4. Set up the databases
(details here - both necessary?)
```
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate
RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:migrate - is there a better way to do this?
```

4. Start the web server from the terminal
`bin/rails server`

5. In a browser, navigate to localhost:3000 and expore the app! You can 
- add a picture
- add a caption for a picture
- see the pictures that have been added

## How to run the test suite

`rspec`

Load coverage/index.html in a browser for full code coverage report.

## How I appraoched this challenge
(link to Trello board?)

Time so far: 9 hours

1. Planning (1h 40m)
- Made a Trello board using the Acebook Challenge template board.
- Looked at Instagram website to see how it worked from a user's perspective
- Draft user stories 
- Mockup the site
- Estimate first feature (post photos) and create acceptance criteria

2. Set up Rails app (1h 40m)

3. TDD features
- post a photo (4h 20m so far) this included some troubleshooting of set up of new computer

## My developer practice
- Used toggl to track my time
- Used a pomodoro timer to ensure I took regular breaks
- Commit regularily
- use linter to check quality code 
- use simplecov to check test coverage
- attempt a TDD approach, whilst still learning rails
