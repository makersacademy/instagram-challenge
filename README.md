Instagram Challenge
===================
This is the solo weekend challenge at the end of week 8 of the Makers coding bootcamp. 
Build Instagram on Rails!

By the weekend of week 8, I had precisely 4 days experience of using Ruby on Rails.

By the end of week 8 all Makers developers can:
- use high-quality processes to build a project in a team

Testing
----
Rspec-Rails, Capybara, SimpleCov with FactoryBot to handle testing with Devise
run `guard` for live (on-save) testing
To view the coverage details `open ./coverage/index.html`

Hosting
----
I hosted the incomplete but moderately functional instagram app on Heroku, mostly so I could challenge myslef with AWS S3 storage that I had struggled with previously. I was trying to recreate a debugging process that I had used to solve my problems in the Facebook clone challenge. Here the blog I finally wrote on [AWS debugging](https://medium.com/team-rof/setting-up-a-rails-app-to-run-production-in-heroku-saving-images-uploaded-via-carrierwave-into-aws-c1cc28b0d6a6).

Shout Outs and other tips:
------
### For correcting post set-up mishaps
1. I ran rails out of the box and didn't realise that the default was a SQLite setup. I really wanted Postgres so I could host on Heroku and for genral familiarity. This guide showed me [how to migrate from SQLite to Postgres](https://www.daveferrara1.com/ruby-in-rails-switch-from-sqlite3-to-postgres/) after I had actually started the project. Doh!

In future, set up your Rails projects with: `rails new my_app_name --database=postgresql`

### Posthumous gitignore
2. When you forget to add those irritating coverage files to your .gitignore file. This is what you want to run before your next commit: `git rm -r --cached ./coverge`

### Testing with Devise
3. Now this is where things get tricky. The moment Devise is installed all my feature tests start failing as you can't navigate anywhere without being a fully verified bona-vide user. This article walked me very gently through the maze of gems and terms like factory and warden and middleware and prevented me from saying "Who needs tests anyway?!"

Official Challenge Instructions
------

## Instructions

* Challenge time: one weekend
* Feel free to use Google, your notes, books, etc., but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## How to start

1. Produce some stories, break them down into tasks, and estimate
2. Fork this repo, clone, etc
3. Initialize a new rails project

Remember to proceed in small steps! Getting confused? Make the steps even smaller.

## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.48.1"
gem "rubocop-rails"
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
