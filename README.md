My approach
===========

This is an attempt to build an Instagram clone. It has been built using
TDD principles. The design process has been guided by the user stories
visible below.

# Technologies used

- Ruby on Rails
- Active Record
- SQLite
- CarrierWave
- Rspec

# User stories
```
- As a user,
  So I can show off my photography skills to the world,
  I want to be able to post an photo.

- As a user,
  So I can see everyone else's photos,
  I want to be able to see a page with all photos listed in reverse
  chronological order.

- As a user,
  so I can let others know that I like their photos,
  I want to be able to leave 'likes' on photos.

- As a user,
  So that I can share my thoughts,
  I want to be able to comment on other photos.

- As a user,
  so that I can be part of the notsoinstagram community,
  I want to be able to sign up.
