#Instagram Challenge

##How To Use

- Clone and run bundle install
- $ bin/rails db:create
- $ bin/rail db:migrate
- $ bin/rails server to see it live
- Run rspec for tests

##Functionality

- Users can sign up, sign in, sing out. They can post a photo as them with a caption. 

##Goals of Feedback
- Help with the things I was stuck on and other general feedback.

#What I found Challenging
 
- Active Storage, testing and implimentation.

#What I think went well

- I'm pleased that I learnt how to use Active Storage, and managed to get the tests for it working. I'm pleased the forgein keys for the user and posts eventually worked.

#What I would have done if I had more time

Time was a big issue for this challenge. If I'd had more time I would have:

- Made the test pass for displaying photos, user_id and captions.
- Used Rubocop
- Worked out how to display the user email instead of Id
- Implimented likes and comments
