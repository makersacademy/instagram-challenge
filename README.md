This project is our 8th weekend challenge and our first week of Rails framework. Completed solo on 8th-9th July 2018. We were tasked with creating a clone of instagram!

## Instructions:  
```
Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).
```

## MVP:

I came up with the following user stories and mock up for my MVP:

<img src="./mvp_user_flow_screenshot.40.30.png" />

```
As a user,
So that I can see what people are up to,
I can see peoples most recent posts
```
```
As a user,
So that I can use instagram,
I can sign up
```
```
As a user,
So that I can access my account,
I can log in
```
```
As a user,
So that I can share what's going on in my life,
I can make a post
```
