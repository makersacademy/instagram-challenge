# Instragram Challenge

## Forward

This challenge is for the week 8-9 students to create a moke Instgram using Ruby on Rails.
A limited number of user stories have been provied and the purpose of the challege is for us to consolidate the Ruby and Rails knowledge that we have gained in the previous weeks.

My personal goal differes slightly in that I would like to use this challenge to document my understanding of Rails and how to use it to quickly create a full stack application. 

*As an aside, I don't anticipate getting very far over the course of the weekend despite my comfort level with the task in hand. It was my fathers birthday on friday and I have been with my extended family since then. Sunday is mothers day and my immediate family are hoping to make a fuss of me. I will dedicate a few hours to this task but if I were employed to do this I would have flagged my unavailability with my bosses before this weekend. Thus avoiding disappointment and frustration. I intend to revisit this challenge in the comming weeks. NB I would not expect to get much further than the planning, modelling and documentation stage in the time give, irl.

## Versions

I am using:
* Ruby version 2.5.3
* Rails version 5.1.7

## Technology
I intend to use `rspec` for the testing, `Devise` for user authentication and `materialize` to ensure that the front end is spectacular.

## Class Responsibility Collaborator Diagram
In this repository with this README is the CRC diagram.
This shows the 2 classes, users and posts but I have extended it to provide information on the possible database tables.

## Background
Now that I have an idea of what I am going to write I now need to work out how.
I am going to use Ruby on Rails for the framework (Ruby as the programming language, clearly).
To install rails I use the following command `rails new grimstagram`
This provides me with the rails framework.
I am using rails version 5.1.7 for this project.
