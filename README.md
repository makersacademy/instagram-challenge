Instagram Challenge
-----

How To Use
-----

- Clone and run bundle install
- $ bin/rails db:create
- $ bin/rail db:migrate
- $ bin/rails server to see it live
- Run rspec for tests

Functionality
-------

- Users can sign up, sign in, sing out. They can post a photo as them with a caption. 

Goals of Feedback
-------
- Help with the things I was stuck on and other general feedback.

What I found Challenging
--------
 
- Active Storage, testing and implimentation.

What I think went well
------

- I'm pleased that I learnt how to use Active Storage, and managed to get the tests for it working. I'm pleased the forgein keys for the user and posts eventually worked.

What I would have done if I had more time
------

Time was a big issue for this challenge. If I'd had more time I would have:

- Made the test pass for displaying photos, user_id and captions.
- Used Rubocop
- Worked out how to display the user email instead of Id
- Implimented likes and comments
