# Instagram Challenge

Build Instagram using Rails. Users will be able to post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).
  
Bonus if you can write your own set of sensible user stories!
  
## User Stories
  
```
As a user,
I want to create an instagram account,
so that I can start posting my pictures

As a user,
I want to log into my instagram account,
so that I can my posts

As a user, 
I want to log out of my instagram account,
so that no one can post under my name

As a user,
I want to log in with my facebook details,
so that I don't have to create new ones

As a user,
I want to be able to post an image,
so that other users can view it

As a user,
I want to be able to edit a post,
so that the post details can be updated

As a user,
I want to be able to delete a post,
so that unwanted posts can be removed
```
