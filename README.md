# Instagram Clone

## Makers Academy - Week 8 (weekend project)

First attempt at this, I am using David Battersby's 'Build an Instagram Clone' Youtube tutorial. Interested in how he uses Bootstrap, SCSS and cloud based image storage.

## Challenges
So many problems!
* Accessing Devise views. Solution - `rails generate devise:views users`
* Yarn issues, not the correct version. Then the webpacker gem wouldn't work - https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/940;
* Issues with gems being the wrong versions - when using carrierwave or AWS use these gems: gem 'carrierwave-aws', gem "fog-aws". Helpful walkthrough - http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/switching-carrierwave-to-use-s3-with-heroku-and-localhost/
* Aws/carrierwave upload problems. Firstly my carrierwave config couldn't find my ENV keys, then the bucket created in AWS wouldn't accept that I was the one uploading to it - had to change the permissions. Solution - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41663925/missing-required-arguments-aws-access-key-id-aws-secret-access-key-in-server; https://www.bitesite.ca/blog/fixing-rails-carrierwave-amazon-s3-403-forbidden-error
* Routing problems with the sign out link - the server keeps reading the pathway as a Get request when the code is a delete/destroy method. Eventually found a work around using 'button_to' with 'link_to', although the css is now off. Solution - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6557311/no-route-matches-users-sign-out-devise-rails-3
* The image_tag couldn't read the pathway until I used string interpolation. This also took a while to work out as the example given in the tutorial didn't have this.
* Challenges with writing tests as the tutorial hasn't been test driven.
* Can't seem to access pictures in a folder in my AWS bucket on my dashboard for no specific reason. Resolved.
* Pictures are also now unable to upload because of mini_magick issues - `Brew Install ImageMagick` I think has solved it (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10810356/carrierwave-error-msg-failed-to-manipulate-with-minimagick-maybe-it-is-not-an)
* Unable to view font awesome characters despite downloading fonts and style sheets. eventually linked to external source - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11052398/rails-using-font-awesome
* Bootstrap can't find module 'jquery' - trying to figure this out. I've tried adding in script lines into the html, require and/or import lines into the application.js, installed the jquery-rails gem
