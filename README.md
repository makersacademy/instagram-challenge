Instagram Challenge
===================

by Thomas Bradley

This is a basic clone of the image sharing website Instagram. It was built using ruby on rails, javascript and activerecord. Testing was done with rspec and capybara, along with the poltergeist driver. Further work to be done includes guarding against some edge cases and proper styling.
