## Instagram challenge
by Ben Vaughan-Jones

### Instructions

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

### User stories
```
- As a user, I would like to be able sign-up, so that I can see posts
- As a user, I would like to sign-in, so I that I can post to the website
- As a user, I would like to post images, so that I can show off my food
- As a user, I would like to be able to edit my post, incase I make a mistake
- As a user, I would like to delete my post, so I can remove the post
- As a user, I would like to like other peoples posts, so I can show my love for their pictures of food
```

### Thoughs
- I really enjoyed this challenge, it was complex and required quite a bit of planning, especially in regards to the associations.
- I had quite a bit of difficulty with the likes function, it would be implementing it locally but when running the tests, the tests would fail.
- The project still requires a bit of logic and validation being applied
- I will be coming back to this project to add styling with Boostrap and CSS.
- I would also like to deploy the application to Heroku once stylised and applying validation
