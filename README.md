## Plan

### MVC

MVC (Model - View - Controller) is an architectural pattern implemented in designing and building software applications. Most commonly, MVC is applied to web applications. The Rails application is split into 3 components:

- Models: Active Record is the _M_ in MVC - the layer responsible for representing business data and logic. Active Record facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database.
- Views: Action View is the _V_ in MVC - the layer responsible for handling user interface objects and presentation.
- Controllers: Action Controller is the _C_ in the MVC - the layer responsible for communicating between the Model and View, it receives user input and executes commands accordingly.

### Request Response Cycle

![Request Response Cycle](public/images/rrcycle.png)

- User opens his browser, types in a URL, and presses Enter. When a user presses Enter, the browser makes a request for that URL.
- The request hits the Rails router (config/routes.rb).
- The router maps the URL to the correct controller and action to handle the request.
- The action receives the request, and asks the model to fetch data from the database.
- The model returns a list of data to the controller action.
- The controller action passes the data on to the view.
- The view renders the page as HTML.
- The controller sends the HTML back to the browser. The page loads and the user sees it.
