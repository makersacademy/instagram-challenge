Task
-----

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Bonus if you can write your own set of sensible user stories!

As usual please start by

* Filling out your learning plan self review for the week: https://github.com/makersacademy/learning_plan_october2015 (if you haven't already)
* Forking this repo. After cloning your fork and cd'ing into it, you'll need to [initialize a Rails app in the current directory](http://blog.jasonmeridth.com/posts/create-rails-application-in-current-directory/).

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!
