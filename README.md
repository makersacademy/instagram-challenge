==================

 ![Alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/pJjKzRqY9HwME/200w_d.gif)

This project is our 8th weekend challenge and our first week of Rails framework. Completed solo on 8th-9th July 2018. We were tasked with creating a clone of instagram!<br>

For context, at time of completion I had 1 week experience with Rails.<br>

Heroku link: https://faldoinstagram.herokuapp.com/

## Instructions:  

```
Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails.
You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**,
write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture.
Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).
```

## MVP:

__I came up with the following user stories and mock up for my MVP:__

<img src="/app/assets/images/mvp_user_flow_sreenshot.40.30.png" />

__And included the following user stories as part of the MVP:__
```
As a user,
So that I can see what people are up to,
I can see peoples most recent posts
```
```
As a user,
So that I can use instagram,
I can sign up
```
```
As a user,
So that I can access my account,
I can log in
```
```
As a user,
So that I can share what's going on in my life,
I can make a text post
```

__See also non-MVP user stories:__

```
As a user,
So that I can give people more visual details,
I can add a photo to my post
```

```
As a user,
So that I can see who posted what,
I can see the posters name next to their post
```
```
As a user,
So that I can express my approval,
I can like a post
```
```
As a user,
So that I can let people know what I think of their posts,
I can write comments on posts (medium)
```
