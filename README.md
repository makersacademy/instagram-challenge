Chitter Challenge
=================

# Introduction
I undertook this project to learn Rails. Through this project, I learnt how to create a Rails project, to create users with Devise, handling file uploads with Paperclip, and I even got to work with Bootstrap a little bit.

This is a very simple clone of Instagram, which allows users to upload photos and comment on them.

This project helped me better understand relational databases.

Here are the user stories provided for functionality:

```
As a user
So that I can post my photos on Chillgram
I want to sign up

As a user
So that I can revist Chillgram
I want to log in

As a user
So that I can stop others uploading to my account
I want to log out

As a user
So that my friends can see my excellent photography skills
I want to upload a photo

As a user
So that I can give a bit more flavour to my photos
I want to add a caption

As a user
So that I can show my appreciation for people's photos
I want to add a comment

As a user
So that I can enjoy the site even more
I want a cool interface

As a user
So that I can see a bunch of photos
I want to see them in reverse chronological order
```
## Approach

In order to solve this, I used the following:

1. **Test-driven development:** I used Capybara and RSpec to test-drive the development of this site.

2. **Domain-modelling:** I listed all of the nouns and verbs involved in each user story, turned them into objects and messages, and implemented them.

3. **Refactoring:** I continuously refactored my code along the way.
