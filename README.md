Instagram Challenge
===================

##Progress
I have managed to setup 3 of the 4 CRUD options. I didn't manage to complete the delete function, which I hope to come back to.

I spent the first part of the weekend learning about Rails, as my group didn't really look into Rails during the Acebook first week. This meant, I didn't have the full weekend to complete the task.

I hope to continue with the challenge when I have some spare time. I would like to add the delete function, a comments function and the ability to register, log in and log out.
