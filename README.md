### User Stories
```
As a user,
so that I can share my photos with the strangers of the internet,
I would like to be able to upload and display a photo.
```

```
As a user,
So that I can look at other users' photos,
I would like to be able to see a feed of uploaded images.
```

```
As a user,
So that I can post photos and comments as me,
I would like to be able to sign up for an account.
```

```
As a user,
So that I can impose my opinions on a wide audience,
I would like to be able to comment on photos.
```

```
As a user,
So that I do not have to actually type to signal my approval,
I would like to be able to 'like' a photo.
```

```
As a user with excellent taste,
So that I can enjoy a brightly coloured and fancy experience,
I would like to use an exquisitely styled website.
```

```
As a whimsical user,
So that my photos are less reflective of reality,
I would like the choice to add a filter to my photos.
```
