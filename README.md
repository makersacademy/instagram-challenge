To begin using this App please go to http://localhost:3000/users/sign_up. (created using gem devise).

This is a partial weekend challenge (MVP) [registering and sign in/out with Devise, adding, deleting, viewing and updating photos].
This project taught me about the Request - response cycle diagram (get /pictures), MVC diagram
I used command line rails to generate a view, a controller, a model, and add routes | rake db:migrate.
