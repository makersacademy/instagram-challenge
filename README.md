```


Approach towards solving the challenge
--------------------------------------

I built the system using test-driven development to ensure that bugs can be eliminated. As you can see the build has 100% coveralls and all RSpec tests are passing.

The instagram clone is fully functional MVP. If you feel that there are any errors or improvements can be made then please let me know.


Technologies used:
------

* The application was coded in Ruby on Rails
* RSpec was used in order to conduct test-driven development
* AWS S3 was used to store images that are uploaded by users
* PostgreSQL is the database used in this project
* HAML was used for the view files

Installation:
------

To run the application you can either visit it on [Heroku](https://usmaninstagram.herokuapp.com/).

-- or --

Download a clone of this repo and use 'rails s' to run it on your localhost.


Tests
------

You can check the tests by running 'rspec' in the root folder of the project in terminal.
