Instagram Challenge
===================

## How to use
* Firstly clone this repo
* Then run `bundle`
* Now if you run `rspec`, the tests should run alongside coverage reports

## Technologies used
* I used simplecov to ensure I was testing enough of my code line by line
* I used RSpec as a testing framework

## Outline
* Build an instagram clone where users can
  * post pictures
  * write comments on the pictures
  * have appropriate styling (like instagram does)
