Instagram Challenge
===================

User stories
------------
* As a user, I want to upload my photos online so
that I can share my artistic genius with others.
* As a user, I want to be able to like other peoples photos so that they know how great they are (and hopefully they'll like my photos in return... #likes4likes).
* As a user, I want to be able to add comments to photos so I express my appreciation or distaste for other people's photos.  
* As Instagram's creator, I want users to be able to log in and out so that Instagram can display who posted which pictures. 

Instructions
-------
* Challenge time: one weekend
* Feel free to use Google, your notes, books, etc., but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Task
-----

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Bonus if you can write your own set of sensible user stories!

As usual please start by forking this repo. After cloning your fork and cd'ing into it, you'll need to [initialize a Rails app in the current directory](http://blog.jasonmeridth.com/posts/create-rails-application-in-current-directory/).

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!
