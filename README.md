Instagram Challenge
===================rails 
## Joanne Chen - Instagram challenge

As I'll be praciticng building an app via Rails, which is a relatively new concept to me, I will be using a tutorial I found on Medium, written by Luan Nguyen to guide me through it. This are the web addresses: https://medium.com/luanotes/build-instagram-by-ruby-on-rails-part-1-fef7837ee399, https://medium.com/luanotes/build-instagram-by-ruby-on-rails-part-2-d70b44f5c7e6, https://medium.com/luanotes/build-instagram-by-ruby-on-rails-part-3-2cb65dca46d7


## Instructions

* Feel free to use Google, your notes, books, etc., but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## How to start

1. Produce some stories, break them down into tasks, and estimate
2. Fork this repo, clone, etc
3. Initialize a new rails project

Remember to proceed in small steps! Getting confused? Make the steps even smaller.

## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.79.0", require: false
gem "rubocop-rails"
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
