 Below, I'll outline the key changes for each section:

### Introduction
- The introduction can remain largely the same, with the focus shifted from Ruby/Rails specific elements to Python/Django.

### Step 0: Checkout and Run tests
- Instead of `rake`, Python uses different commands. You would use `python manage.py test` to run tests in Django.
- Running the Django server is done with `python manage.py runserver`.
- Installation instructions will change from using Bundler (Ruby) to pip (Python) or a similar package manager.

### Step 1: How far did they get?
- Feature requirements remain the same, but implementation details will follow Django's MVC (Model-View-Template) pattern.

### Step 2: Structure and supporting files
- Django projects have a different structure than Rails projects, but the principle of clear, user-friendly READMEs with setup instructions remains the same.
- The commands for setting up and running the app will change to Django-specific ones.

### Step 3: Tests and \*\_spec.rb files
- Replace Ruby/RSpec syntax with Python's unittest or pytest.
- Django uses a different testing framework, so the syntax and structure of tests will differ.
- Instead of `describe` and `it` blocks, Python uses classes and methods for tests.
- The principles of good testing (clarity, coverage, etc.) are the same, but the implementation will follow Python's conventions.

### Step 4: Application code and \*.rb files
- All Ruby code will need to be translated to Python, following Django's conventions.
- Helpers in Django are typically achieved using template tags and filters.
- Nested forms in Django are handled differently; Django has its own form system.
- Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) differs from ActiveRecord, so database interactions will follow Django's query syntax.
- Routing in Django is managed in `urls.py` files.
- Controller logic in Django is handled by views (functions or classes in `views.py`).
- Model associations in Django (like `ForeignKey` for one-to-many relationships) will replace Rails associations (`has_many`, `belongs_to`).

### Views and Templates
- Django uses its own templating language, so ERB templates will be replaced with Django templates.
- Semantic HTML and best practices for JavaScript remain the same, but how they are integrated into Django will differ.

### Additional Django-Specific Considerations
- Django's admin interface for managing data models.
- Django's middleware for handling requests and responses.
- Django's settings configuration, which differs from Rails' environment files.

Remember, this is a high-level overview. The specific changes would depend on the details of the code and the exact requirements of the project. Python and Django have different idioms and best practices compared to Ruby and Rails, so it's important to familiarize yourself with these when making the transition.
