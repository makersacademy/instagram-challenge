Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails.
You'll need users who can post pictures, write comments on pictures and like a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

MVP:

As an alienated and exhausted new mother
So I can feel part of a community
I would like to SIGN UP to BubHub

So I can seek reassurance from other mums
I must be able to POST PHOTOS with a caption

As a new mother
So I can feel reassured my baby looks normal.
I must be able to SEE POSTS made by other mums.

I must be able to MAKE COMMENTS on their photos

As a member of the BubHub community
So I can make other mums feel less suicidal
I must be able to LIKE their photos
