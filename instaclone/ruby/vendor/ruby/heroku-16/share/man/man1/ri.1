.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBri\fP
is a CLI front end for the Ruby API reference.
You can search and read API reference for classes and methods with
\fB.\fP

\fBri\fP
is a part of Ruby.

\fItarget\fP
can be one of the following forms:
It Class
for classes
It Class::method
for class methods
It Class#method
for instance methods
It Class.method
for both class and instance methods
It method
for both class and instance methods

All class names may be abbreviated to their minimum unambiguous form. If a name
is ambiguous, all valid options will be listed.

For example:

ri Fil
.br
ri File
.br
ri File.new
.br
ri zip
.br

Note that shell quoting may be required for method names containing
punctuation:

ri 'Array.[]'
.br
ri compact\!
