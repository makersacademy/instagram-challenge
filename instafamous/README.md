Instagram Challenge
===================

Task
-----

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Summary
=================

* Developed a basic rails app to develop a mock photo sharing live feed web app and explore the rails framework

* Implemented core usability features (e.g. upload pictures, leave comments, like pictures) and core user authentication (e.g. log-in, log-out to upload pictures and comments)

Use Cases:
-------

```
- [x] As a user,
      So that I can see other pictures in the network,
      I want to see a list of all pictures on the homepage

- [x] As a user,
      So that I can add pictures to the site,
      I want to be able to upload my own pictures to the homepage

- [x] As a user,
      So that I can see what other people are saying about pictures,
      I want to click on a icon to reveal a list of all comments on each picture

- [x] As a user,
      So that I can make sure I only add my own pictures,
      I want to be able to login to the website

- [x] As a user,
      So that I can comment with others
      I want to be able to leave comments on pictures from the homepage

- [x] As a user,
      So that no one makes comments as me,
      I only want to be able to leave comments when logged in

- [x] As a user,
      So that I can like my favourite pictures,
      I want a like button on each picture

- [x] As a user,
      So that I can dislike pictures,
      I want a dislike button on each picture

```
