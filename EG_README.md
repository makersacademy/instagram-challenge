# **Ed Goold's Instagram Weekend Challenge - Makers Academy Dec 2017 Cohort**

## **Introduction**

This is my response to Makers' Academy's weekend challenge from February 2017.  
The idea is to build a clone of Instagram using Ruby-on-Rails and other  
associated resources over the course of one weekend.

More widely, this constitutes one element of the Makers Academy full-time coding  
bootcamp curriculum.

## **User Stories**

Up until this point, we have been working with pre-defined User Stories when  
completing our weekend coursework challenges, however at this stage that support  
falls away and we are asked to formulate our own User Stories that capture Instagram's  
essential functionality to serve as a framework for our project.

Based on my understanding of the application, I have created the following User Stories:

#### **User Story 1**

```  
As a user
I want to sign-up to an image focused social media site
So that I can share my images with other users
```

#### **User Story 2**

```
As a user
I want to post my images
So that I and other users can see them
```

#### **User Story 3**

```
As a user
I want to post comments to images
So that other users can see what I make of them
```

#### **User Story 4**

```
As a user
I want to be able to "like" images
So that other users can see which images are my favourites
```
