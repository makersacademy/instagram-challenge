# # describe PublicHelper do
# #   describe "string concat" do
# #     it "concats two strings with spaces" do
# #       expect(helper.concat_strings("this","that")).to eq("this that")
# #     end
# #   end
# # end
# RSpec.describe PublicHelper, type: :helper do
#   pending "add some examples to (or delete) #{__FILE__}"
