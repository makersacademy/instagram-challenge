  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  # storage :file
  # storage :fog
  storage (Rails.env.test? ? :file : :fog)

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:
  def store_dir
    "uploads/#{model.class.to_s.underscore}/#{mounted_as}/#{model.id}"
  end

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  # def default_url
  #   # For Rails 3.1+ asset pipeline compatibility:
  #   # ActionController::Base.helpers.asset_path("fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_'))
  #
  #   "/images/fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_')
  # end

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  process :resize_to_fit => [600, 600]
  # process :scale => [200, 300]
  # #
  # def scale(width, height)

  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  # version :thumb do
  #   process :resize_to_fit => [50, 50]
  # end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # def filename
  #   "something.jpg" if original_filename
  # end

  # If you like, you can call this inside a version like this
  # instead of at the top level.
  # That will store the dimensions for this version.
  #   version :main, :if => :image?  do
  #       process :resize_to_fit => [240, 180] ,:if => :horizontal?
  #       process :resize_to_fit => [240, 320]  ,:if => :vertical?
  #   end
